# DataValidation
Simple program that validates the formatting of each line in an input file.

## Usage
This program reads an input file and matches each data segment to a pattern. If the patterns and
data segments don't match it creates an error code for the segment that is wrong.
Lines that contain no formatting errors are pasted in a valid data file. Lines
that do contain errors, have it's error codes pasted in an invalid data file.
